      <h3>Musical Journey</h3>
      <p>Alexandra began her musical journey in 4th grade, switching from clarinet to saxophone and immediately falling
        in love with the instrument's expressive voice. She was drawn to the saxophone's ability to convey emotion and
        tell stories without words. What started as a school band class quickly became a meaningful part of her life.
        Over time, she expanded her skills to include alto, tenor, and baritone saxophones. Her musical experiences have
        helped her grow not only as a performer but also as a leader and mentor in the music community. Alexandra views
        music as a lifelong pursuit—one that brings people together and sparks creativity, confidence, and joy.</p>

      <h3>Performance Experience</h3>
      <p>Alexandra is a dedicated and experienced performer who has participated in a wide range of musical ensembles.
        She currently plays in the Woodinville High School Wind Ensemble and Jazz Band, where she also serves as the
        secretary and tenor saxophone section leader. In her role as music curator for the jazz band, she helps select
        and explore pieces that introduce new styles and broaden her peers’ musical understanding. Alexandra has also
        played in the pit orchestra for theatrical productions like <em>Footloose</em>, where she learned the nuances of
        timing, precision, and collaboration in a live setting. In addition to large ensembles, she enjoys playing in
        chamber groups, where intimate teamwork and musicianship are key. Her well-rounded background has prepared her
        to approach all kinds of performances with versatility and professionalism.</p>

      <h3>Teaching Philosophy</h3>
      <p>Alexandra is a thoughtful and supportive teacher who believes in meeting students where they are and helping
        them grow at their own pace. She combines a structured approach with creativity, working to build strong
        technical fundamentals while also nurturing musical curiosity. Her teaching emphasizes the importance of
        problem-solving, encouraging students to understand their instrument deeply so they can grow more independently.
        Alexandra aims to make each lesson feel rewarding and inspiring, adapting her instruction based on each
        student’s learning style, goals, and interests. Whether the student is a beginner learning to make their first
        sounds or an advanced player preparing for an audition, Alexandra brings patience, insight, and enthusiasm to
        every lesson. Her ultimate goal is to help students develop not just as musicians, but as confident individuals
        who find joy and purpose through music.</p>
