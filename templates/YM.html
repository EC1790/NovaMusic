        <h3>Musical Journey</h3>
        <p>Yasin has been playing drums for two years so far and heavily enjoys the art. He greatly enjoys the way that drums support the main ensemble and what they can add to a piece. He enjoys how creative you can be with them, all the different kinds of possibilities and feels that drums open up for music. He’s very glad that he decided to take up drumming, and feels that he is ready to start sharing it with others.</p>

        <h3>Performance and Experience</h3>
        <p>Throughout his time playing drums, Yasin has had a sizable amount of experience playing with marching, concert and jazz bands, meaning that he is versatile in most situations and understands how to correctly play the drums within different contexts. He is able to help give feedback on what the piece might need, and can easily adjust to help others. Yasin has also played in extracurricular gigs with the jazz band.</p> 

        <h3>Advancing Music Education</h3>
        <p>Throughout his time so far, Yasin has figured that the best way to teach is to try and look at the problem from the student’s point of view. By doing this, the teacher gets a better understanding on what the student needs to work on first before conquering their main problem, and that is where the teacher helps and offers support for their students, ensuring that they have a proper grasp on fundamentals before moving on to bigger challenges.</p>
