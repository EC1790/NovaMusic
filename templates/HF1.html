        <h3>Musical Journey</h3>
        <p>Hayden started playing trumpet in fifth grade and has continued since then. In high school, he switched to French horn for concert band while staying on trumpet for jazz band. He currently plays in Inglemoor’s concert band, prep band, marching band, and jazz band, performing at school assemblies, sports games, and send-offs. His experience reflects consistent involvement in school music programs.</p>
        
        <h3>Performance Experience</h3>
        <p>Hayden has participated in several music events and festivals. In middle school, his group received the highest rating at the Northshore School Music Festival. In high school, he performed at the Northshore Jazz Festival and took part in Solo and Ensemble. He also attended band camp for the first time this year. These experiences have given him a range of performance opportunities in both group and solo settings.</p> 

        <h3>Teaching Philosophy</h3>
        <p>Hayden’s teaching approach focuses on demonstrating musical examples to help students understand concepts like accents and dynamics. While he finds it challenging to explain details like embouchure, he can clearly model what students need to play. He is comfortable teaching from method books and understands basic trumpet maintenance, including cleaning and oiling. He can also support students on French horn with similar musical guidance.</p>
