      <h3>Musical Journey</h3>
      <p>Isaac’s musical path began in 2nd grade with the guitar, where he first developed his appreciation for rhythm
        and sound. In 4th grade, he transitioned to the drums, which introduced him to the joy of dynamic expression and
        ensemble playing. Eventually, in 9th grade, Isaac found his primary passion in the horn, where he discovered the
        full depth of musical tone, control, and melodic storytelling. Today, Isaac plays both drums and horn with skill
        and enthusiasm, enjoying the versatility of mastering both rhythm and melody. His journey through different
        instruments has given him a unique, well-rounded musical perspective that informs both his playing and his
        teaching.</p>

      <h3>Performance Experience</h3>
      <p>Isaac has built a rich performance portfolio over the years, starting with solo and ensemble competitions in
        both middle and high school. His talent has led him to perform in some of the most prestigious venues in
        Washington, including Benaroya Hall and Meany Hall in Seattle—settings that require strong musical discipline
        and stage presence. In addition to local performances, Isaac is taking his music international, touring Portugal
        in the summer to perform across the country. This wide range of experience has taught him how to connect with
        audiences, adapt to different performance settings, and embrace music as a global language.</p>

      <h3>Teaching Philosophy</h3>
      <p>Isaac brings a calm, focused, and innovative approach to teaching. He believes that students learn best when
        lessons are both structured and flexible—anchored in strong fundamentals, yet always evolving with fresh content
        and engaging material. Isaac is attentive to each student’s learning style and pace, ensuring that they stay
        motivated and continue to grow as musicians. His approach balances consistency with creativity, making sure that
        students are always developing their technique while staying excited about their musical journey. Isaac’s goal
        is to inspire students to find joy and pride in their playing while equipping them with the skills to continue
        learning for years to come.</p>
